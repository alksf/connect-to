connect-to
===

# What is it?
Simple command-line connection manager.

# Requirements
Any `sh-compatible command language interpreter` for running script, `grep` and `Coreutils`. For now autocompletion works with `zsh` only. `Sshfs` for mount remote file systems.

# Installing
Download, review, modify vars in script.

If you want autocomletion, then place file _connect-to somewhere in your $fpath. If you don’t want (or don’t have the permission) to add files into a directory in $fpath, you can create a directory in your home directory (for example, .config/zsh/completions/) and prepend that directory to the list in $fpath by adding these commands to your `$HOME/.zshrc`.

`
fpath=(~/.config/zsh/completions $fpath)

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
`

Place .myhosts in your $HOMEDIR (it's default) and add some your favorite host(-s) in it like in exapmple:

`
localhost;ssh;alksf@127.0.0.1;My favorite host
google;browser;https://google.com;Google Search
router;telnet;192.168.1.1;My Homenet router
`

`.myhosts` is semicolon delimited csv file. Format of `.myhosts` file:

    1. Identifier of host (hostname e.g.)
    2. Connection method. ssh, as usual, but it cat be any you like: telnet, browser.
    3. username@hostname for ssh, hostname for telnet, URL for browser, etc.
    4. Description. It's optional, you can write here any description or comment here.

Then execute the script

# Usage
